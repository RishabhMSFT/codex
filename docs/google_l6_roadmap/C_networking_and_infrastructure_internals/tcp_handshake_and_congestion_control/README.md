# TCP handshake and congestion control

## In simple words
TCP handshake and congestion control is about making systems work reliably when traffic is high, failures happen, and teams are moving fast. Think of it as building roads, traffic lights, and emergency exits for software.

## Why this matters for a Google Staff interview
Interviewers want to see if you can make clear tradeoffs, explain them simply, and protect customer experience during failures.

## Learn it step by step
1. Understand the basic idea with one diagram.
2. Learn where it fails in real production.
3. Practice one lab and write what broke.
4. Explain your final design in 5 minutes to a non-expert.

## Hands-on exercise
- Build a small demo in your home lab or cloud sandbox.
- Add logs and metrics.
- Intentionally break one part, then recover it.

## Capstone Project (Knowledge Test)
Create a mini production-ready project where this topic is the main design decision. Include:
- Problem statement
- Chosen design and 2 alternatives
- Failure scenario and recovery plan
- Measured result (latency, error rate, MTTR, or cost)
